# Fika: A high-level git extension that helps team-shared development workflow.

## Overview

---

Git is at the heart of the development workflow.

Git is great tool and in modern development we can not survive without it.

But it can be scary and hard for even experienced developers.

> **Maxine is still the only person who knows every keyboard shortcut from vi to the latest, greatest editors. But she is never ashamed to tell anyone that she still needs to look up nearly every command line option for Gitâ€”because Git can be scary and hard! What other tool uses SHA-1 hashes as part of its UI?** _from Unicorn Project, Gene Kim_

The goal of this extension is to make it simple to configure and share team-based git workflow strategy and to make teammates easy to follow the configured strategy.

Also Fika provides integration with issue tracking tools (e.g. Notion, Jira) and with github.

With Fika, no more manual creation of issue and pull request and manual linking with issue tracking tools.
